# MERN Todo
Todo: keep a track of all your tasks :)


Created in MERN Stack, the Todo app is a convenient tool that streamlines the task management process, providing a user-friendly interface to create, edit, and organize your to-do lists seamlessly.

## Steps to install:
1. Make sure you have Git and Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Open your command-line interface (e.g., Terminal, Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository.
3. Clone the repository by running the following command:
4.   git clone https://github.com/mareyam/Todo_frontend.git  https://github.com/mareyam/Todo_backend.git
5.   cd Todo_frontend and cd Todo_backend
6.   npm install
7.   npm run dev and npm start respectively

Why I chose React?
I chose React to develop this project because of its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable code. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders changes, resulting in fast and performant user interfaces. The extensive React ecosystem provides a wide range of libraries and community support. Additionally, React's declarative syntax and JSX make it intuitive and easy to write and understand code.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
